## Support notes:    
Most reliable way to update battery powered devices   
1. Place the sensor near Homey (< 1 meter)   
2. Change the settings to the values you want   
3. Wake up the sensor    
4. During the blinking of the LED (indicating connection to Homey) press "save settings"   

If problems persists:    
a. Temporarely disable other Z-wave apps   
b. change the setting to another value with above steps   
c. check if effective and retry to the desired value
